workflow
AR -> connect and send will (MAC address)
AR -> send WiFiregister
AR -> send monitor

AR <- receive update configuration
AR <- receive medium themperature

SRV -> send UpdateCFG (using MAC as key)
SRV -> send themperature update if more then one AR are present and meausure type is set with medium themperature
SRV -> send on/off to shelly
